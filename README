* SPED
- MAX_ED_EVENTS 65536
- READ_CHUNK_SIZE 1024
- EVENT_WAIT_TIMEOUT 1000
- FASTCGI_SERV_ADDR "127.0.0.1" /* probably need to change to some unix machine */
- FASTCGI_SERV_PORT "12345"
- SERVERQUEUELENGTH 50 
/* I think this is the accept queue: should be
   canged according to the accept()able paper */

* MT
NTHREADS 64 /* Not sure what the ideal number should be */
SBUFSIZE 65535

HTTPERF commandline
* httperf --hog --server unix13.andrew.cmu.edu --port=10452 --uri=/2KB.txt --http-version=1.0 --rate=X --num-conns=X*90 --timeout=x

Synthetic workload:
SPED vs MT vs AMPED
- Static file
  * no caching
  * increase file size and measure:
    1. Bandwidth
    2. Connection rate
- Dynamic file
  * no caching (obviously)
  * increase file size and measure
    1. Bandwidth
    2. Connection rate
- Optimized dynamic file
  * no caching (obviously)
  * increase file size and measure
