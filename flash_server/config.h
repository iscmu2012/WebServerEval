** Restricting CGI programs to a single directory lets the site administrator

** are individual users that you trust, you can enable their directories too.
**
** You can also specify a CGI pattern on the command line, with the -c flag.
** Such a pattern overrides this compiled-in default.
**
** If no CGI pattern is specified, neither here nor on the command line,

** 1) Map ~username to <prefix>/username.  This is the recommended choice.
** Each user gets a subdirectory in the main chrootable web tree, and
** the tilde construct points there.  The prefix could be something
** like "users", or it could be empty.  See also the makeweb program
** for letting users create their own web subdirectories.
**
** 2) Map ~username to <user's homedir>/<postfix>.  The postfix would be
** the name of a subdirectory off of the user's actual home dir, something
** like "public_html".  This is what NCSA and other servers do.  The problem
** is, you can't do this and chroot() at the same time, so it's inherently
** a security hole.  This is strongly dis-recommended, but it's here because
** some people really want it.  Use at your own risk.
**
** You can also leave both options undefined, and thttpd will not do
** anything special about tildes.  Enabling both options is an error.

**
